    "Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients for those predictors which contribute very less in the model but have huge weights, very close to zero. But it never makes them exactly zero. Thus, the final model will still contain all those predictors, though with less weights. This doesn‚Äôt help in interpreting the model very well. This is where Lasso regression differs with Ridge regression. In Lasso, the L1 penalty does reduce some coefficients exactly to zero when we use a sufficiently large tuning parameter Œª. So, in addition to regularizing, lasso also performs feature selection.\n"

    "Regularization helps to reduce the variance of the model, without a substantial increase in the bias. If there is variance in the model that means that the model won‚Äôt fit well for dataset different that training data. The tuning parameter Œª controls this bias and variance tradeoff. When the value of Œª is increased up to a certain limit, it reduces the variance without losing any important properties in the data. But after a certain limit, the model will start losing some important properties which will increase the bias in the data. Thus, the selection of good value of Œª is the key.\n",
    "The value of Œª is selected using cross-validation methods. A set of Œª is selected and cross-validation error is calculated for each value of Œª and that value of Œª is selected for which the cross-validation error is minimum.\n"
